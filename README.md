# Lab: IAM Users, Groups, and Policies

## Overview

In this lab, you'll set up IAM for a fictional development team. You'll create users, organize them into groups, assign permissions, and verify that access control works as expected. This simulates real-world IAM administration for cloud teams.

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes (core), up to 90 minutes with bonus tasks

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create IAM users with appropriate permissions
- Organize users into groups with assigned policies
- Test permissions by signing in as different users
- Enable MFA for enhanced security
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to review permissions
- Apply the principle of least privilege

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with administrative access
- Understanding of IAM concepts from lessons
- Ability to use multiple browser profiles or incognito windows

---

## Scenario

You're the cloud administrator for a development team with the following members:

- **Alice** - Senior Developer (needs full S3 access, read-only EC2)
- **Bob** - Junior Developer (needs limited S3 access to dev bucket only)
- **Charlie** - DevOps Engineer (needs full access to EC2 and S3)

You need to set up IAM users and groups to manage their permissions efficiently.

## Exercise 1: Create IAM Groups

Groups make it easier to manage permissions for multiple users.

### Part A: Create Developers Group

**1. Navigate to IAM**
- AWS Console → Search "IAM" → IAM Dashboard

**2. Create Group**
- In left sidebar: User groups → Create group
- Group name: `Developers`
- Don't attach policies yet → Create group

### Part B: Create DevOps Group

**1. Create Second Group**
- User groups → Create group
- Group name: `DevOps`
- Don't attach policies yet → Create group

### Deliverable:
- Screenshot of both groups created: `screenshots/groups-created.png`

---

## Exercise 2: Attach Policies to Groups

Now we'll assign appropriate permissions to each group.

### Part A: Developers Group Permissions

**1. Select Developers Group**
- Click on "Developers" group

**2. Attach Policies**
- Permissions tab → Add permissions → Attach policies
- Search and select:
  - ☑️ `AmazonS3FullAccess`
  - ☑️ `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`
- Click "Attach policies"

### Part B: DevOps Group Permissions

**1. Select DevOps Group**
- Click on "DevOps" group

**2. Attach Policies**
- Permissions tab → Add permissions → Attach policies
- Search and select:
  - ☑️ `AmazonS3FullAccess`
  - ☑️ `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
- Click "Attach policies"

### Deliverables:
- Screenshot of Developers group permissions: `screenshots/developers-permissions.png`

## Troubleshooting

**Can't create IAM users:**
- Ensure you're signed in as root or admin user
- Check IAM permissions

**"Not authorized" error:**
- This might be expected for limited users
- Document what works and doesn't

**MFA not working:**
- Check device time sync
- Try rescanning QR code

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **Why use groups instead of attaching policies directly to users?**
2. **What are the risks of giving everyone AdministratorAccess?**
3. **How would you organize IAM for 50 developers across 5 projects?**
4. **What happens if you delete an IAM user?**

Answer in `SOLUTION.md`.

**Good luck! 🔐**
